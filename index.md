meta-description: ScandEval Benchmark of language models on Scandinavian language tasks
---
The `ScandEval` benchmark can be used to compare pretrained language models on
Scandinavian language tasks. The benchmark evaluates the models on a variety of tasks:
named entity recognition, sentiment classification, linguistic acceptability and
question answering. By "Scandinavian" we here mean Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (both
Bokmål and Nynorsk).

The [Leaderboard](https://scandeval.github.io/nlu-benchmark/) contains the
result of finetuning the language model 10 times, and evaluating each of these 10
finetuned models on a bootstrapped version of the test set of the given dataset
(different bootstrap for each of the 10 runs). The mean of these 10 scores for the
given (model, dataset) pair are then presented in the leaderboard, with an associated
95% confidence interval.

All benchmark results have been computed using the associated
[ScandEval Python package](https://github.com/saattrupdan/ScandEval), which you
can use to replicate the results as well. A paper on the package and
leaderboards is in preparation, describing the methodology and all the datasets
used in more depth.
